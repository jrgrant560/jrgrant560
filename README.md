Hi. My name is Jacob Grant.

I am a Full Stack Web Developer, specializing in Front End Work using React.



My Preferred Tech Stack (but I'm open to learning what's needed):

  💻 Front End: React
  
  ⚙️ Back End: NextJS / dotNET
  
  📂 Database: MySQL
  
  🚀 Deployment: Github, Netlify, considering Firebase
  
  ⌨️ IDE: VS Code
  


🔷️🔷️🔷️  ~~  EXPERIENCE  ~~ 🔷️🔷️🔷️


  🔷️🔷️ EDUCATION: I was professionally trained by Bethel School of Technology on all core developer principles and Agile methodologies.


  🔷️🔷️ PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE: Interned for Designing Glory as a Front-end Developer.


Technologies I am proficient in:

  🔷️ JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX
  
  🔷️ C# (C Sharp)
  
  🔷️ Java
  
  🔷️ SQL

🔷️🔷️ Management Experience: Director of Operations 🔷️🔷️

As Director of Operations at a small family-owned equipment repair company, my responsibilities included Dispatch, Inventory management, Contract management, Conflict Resolution, Scheduling, and occasional Sales work. My efforts freed the Owner to focus only on high-level decisions, rather than directing daily operations.
During my time in this position, I used Google Sheets to create the company's first shared Task Charting system to track the status of pending equipment deliveries, which streamlined communication between departments and drastically reduced the need for the Owner's oversight.

I also used my graphic design and Office suite experience to create new document templates for the systems we implemented, as well as professional customer-facing documents.

While training my replacement, I wrote the company's first Admin Support Guide, detailing the core Mindset and Goals of the Admin team and how to perform complex functions and deal with uncommon scenarios. This ensured a smooth transition for my employer as I switched careers.
