Hi. My name is Jacob Grant.
I am a Full Stack Web Developer, always seeking opportunities to serve and collaborate with other diligent workers.

🔷️🔷️ Technical Experience 🔷️🔷️

I was professionally trained by Bethel School of Technology, and am always exploring other internet resources for new ideas and guidance.
I have coding experience with:
🔷️ JavaScript, TypeScript
🔷️ C# (C Sharp)
🔷️ Java
🔷️ SQL
🔷️ Angular
🔷️ .NET (dotNET)

I have also received training in:
🔷️ Agile Project Management
🔷️ Scrum
🔷️ GitHub
🔷️ Web Security

🔷️🔷️ Management Experience: Director of Operations 🔷️🔷️
As Director of Operations at a small family-owned equipment repair company, my responsibilities included Dispatch, Inventory management, Contract management, Conflict Resolution, Scheduling, and occasional Sales work. My efforts freed the Owner to focus only on high value decisions, rather than directing daily operations.
During my time in this position, I used Google Sheets to create the company's first shared Task Charting system to track the status of pending equipment deliveries, which streamlined communication between departments and drastically reduced the need for the Owner's oversight.
I also used my graphic design and Office suite experience to create new document templates for the systems we implement, as well as professional customer-facing documents.
While training my replacement, I wrote the company's first Admin Support Guide, detailing the core Mindset and Goals of the Admin team and how to perform complex functions and deal with uncommon scenarios. This ensured a smooth transition for my employer as I switched careers.
